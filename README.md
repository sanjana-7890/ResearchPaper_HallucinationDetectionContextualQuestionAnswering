# ResearchPaper_HallucinationDetectionContextualQuestionAnswering
Carrying out my Hallucination Detection Model from Hackathon to a Research Paper by working on 8 different models and a more large dataset.<br>
After evaluating the performance of all the models, it was evident that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed the other models. It achieved the highest accuracy of 82% and the highest F1 Score of 83.2%. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) combines the predictions of multiple models to deliver a robust and accurate classification. The ensemble approach of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) proves to be effective in hallucination detection in textual data, specifically in the context of contextual question answering.<br>
• Accuracy: SVM has the highest accuracy of 0.8417, followed closely by Logistic Regression and Random Forest.<br>
• Precision: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest show competitive precision scores, but SVM slightly outperforms the others.<br>
• Recall: Bidirectional LSTM has the highest recall of 0.9851, indicating its ability to correctly identify positive samples. However, SVM and Naive Bayes also perform well in terms of recall.<br>
• F1 Score: SVM has the highest F1 score of 0.8848, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.<br>
• ROC Curve: Naive Bayes has the highest ROC AUC score of 0.89, followed closely by Bidirectional LSTM.<br>
