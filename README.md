# ResearchPaper_HallucinationDetectionContextualQuestionAnswering
Carrying out my Hallucination Detection Model from Hackathon to a Research Paper by working on 8 different models and a more large dataset.<br>
After evaluating the performance of all the models, it is evident that the Voting Classifier outperformed the other models. It achieved the highest accuracy of 82% and the highest F1 Score of 83.2%. The Voting Classifier combines the predictions of multiple models to deliver a robust and accurate classification. The ensemble approach of the Voting Classifier proves to be effective in hallucination detection in textual data, specifically in the context of contextual question answering. The Voting Classifier outperformed other algorithms in hallucination detection for the following reasons: <br>

â€¢	Voting Classifier combines predictions from different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. The diverse selection of models contributes to its improved performance.
